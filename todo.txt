Loose Ideas ::::

Add integrations ::
  Spotify for whatever is cool: playlists, liked songs, etc
  Github for a select set of repositories, descriptions, links, urls

Frontend design ::
  Home page
  Click arrow or swipe right and left to "roll" through pages
  Dim in out pages as transitioned?
  Maybe add menu as well to do the same
  Rolling menu with center item and items to left and right that are progressively more dirname
  Roll to page and scroll content per page
  Likely want one large statically generated page with all pages and then render components as needed on the pages

Add sections ::
  repos, quotes, movies, artists, albums, songs, videos, photos
  certifications

maybe split into two sides:
tech / adventure
inside / outside
