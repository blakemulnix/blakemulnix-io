Last spring I took a trip out west. Covered 6300 miles over 3 weeks. I hit CO, UT, AZ, CA (from south to north along the coast), NV, ID, and WY. I brought only a recently purchaes FujiFilm camera and took over 5000 photos. 

Since then, I have been wanting to share those photos, but I'm not on any social media sites where I can share them. So, I took a bit of time to set up site where I can share some of the highlights from that trip and others.

This was a fun little project. Here's how I built it:

I set up some basic infrastructure with SST v2:
  - An S3 bucket
  - A lambda to create thumbnail photos that gets run when new photos are added
  - A NextJS site
    - frontend to fetch and display photos
    - small API to surface the list of photos, their relevant metadata, and urls

That all took less than 100 lines of infrastructure as code!

Now, I can simply add some photos and text to a folder within my repo, do a `yarn deploy:prod`, and ba-da-boom,
they are available for your viewing pleasure.

You can check it out over at photos.blakemulnix.io

Hopefully this provides me the long await motivation to sift through all those photos and make some edits!



also add links on instagram and facebook that just link to my website
